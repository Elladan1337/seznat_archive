# seznat_archive
A tool that periodically archives the list of Czech judicial experts and court translators

The repo consists of two files: 

main.py - which downloads and labels the lists of Czech judicial experts and court translators in CSV format. Other formats can also be downloaded by editing the URLs (XML, JSON, XLS).

local.seznat.plist - a local launchd agent for MacOS which runs on the 1st day of every month @Â 12:00 PM and downloads the given files. This allows for continual data gathering building a database for future research. For more information consult: https://www.launchd.info
